# Solana Bookkeeper Service

# Problem
* In the fast-paced Solana blockchain environment, tracking and analyzing wallet transactions manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing analytics platforms, such as gmgn.ai, often show discrepancies of 30% or more in actual earnings calculations due to limited on-chain data parsing and inaccurate trade grouping. Users lack visibility into real trading performance, slippage, and failed transactions ‚Äî especially when operating across many tokens with varying transaction logic. There‚Äôs also no built-in way to get reliable, automated daily or weekly insights without building a custom system.

# Solution
* This service automatically monitors all transactions of a specific Solana wallet, accurately identifies completed token trades, and calculates associated fees, slippage, profits, and losses with high precision. It automatically generates a user-friendly dashboard in Google Sheets that presents all deal data in a clear and accessible format, making it easy to analyze performance at a glance. Additionally, it sends actionable daily and weekly summaries to Telegram. Unlike other tools, it reconstructs trade flows using detailed on-chain balance changes, resulting in realistic earnings data and better decision-making for active traders.
